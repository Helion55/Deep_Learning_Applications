# Machine Learning & Deep Learning applications
## Overview
These two Applications are created using
- Python
- Tensorflow
- Keras Library
- Random Forest Algorithm
- Linear Regression
- Autoencoders
### Performance Prediction of Player 
A Machine Learning model to predict a playes performance on next match. This model is Perdicting Virat Kohli's performance on next match against selected team.
The model was trained with Linear Regression algorithm to predict player is going to score how many fours in next match. which is giving an accuracy of 86%.
Another model was trained with Random Forest algorithm to predict player is going to score how many runs in the next match, which is giving an accuracy of 96%.
### Image-Colorisation
This is Image Colorisation application is to convert B&W images to Colorised image. Autoencoders are used to process the output. This is a Deep Learning which is using Keras image Library data.
The Results are based on few number of epochs which can be fine tuned on more number of epochs or more data set is provided to the model and it will need more computation power to produce better results.
